### Notes

I do not understand the instructions for multiple shared element transitions and I'm not sure how to add an overlay for popular movies. Is it necessary to have one since it autoplays?

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
I had difficulty figuring out where to modify the view to display the backdrop image. I also wanted to add a click listener to highlight a currently selected item. I tried
to implement a loading GIF but toGif() is no longer part of the library and it does not load the image as a GIF by default.

It may be difficult to see in the GIF but there is about 20 frames of the loading image displayed at the beginning. Changing the network setting to anything slower than LTE
resulted in no data being loaded.
